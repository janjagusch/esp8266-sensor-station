  The DHT22 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor.
  It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air,
  and spits out a digital signal on the data pin.
  It's fairly simple to use, but requires careful timing to grab data.
  The only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds,
  so when using our library, sensor readings can be up to 2 seconds old.

  Wiring for ESP8266 NodeMCU boards:
    * VCC to 3V3
    * PIN 2 to whatever your DHT22_DATA_PIN is (default: D4)
    * Connect a 10k resistor from PIN 2 to VCC
    * GND to GND

The TSL2561 luminosity sensor is an advanced digital light sensor, ideal for use in a wide range of light situations.
Compared to low cost CdS cells, this sensor is more precise, allowing for exact lux calculations and can be configured
for different gain/timing ranges to detect light ranges from up to 0.1 - 40,000+ Lux on the fly.
The best part of this sensor is that it contains both infrared and full spectrum diodes! That means you can separately measure infrared,
full-spectrum or human-visible light.

Wiring for ESP8266 NodeMCU boards:
  * Connect VCC to 3.3V
  * Connect GND to GND
  * Connect SCL to SCL
  * Connect SDA to SDA
